    If possible, provide a suggested fix or mitigation.

Response Process

    You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours.

    Our security team will investigate the issue and provide an update within 7 days.

    If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a resolution and communicate progress updates.

What to Expect

    If the vulnerability is accepted, we will prioritize a fix based on severity and impact.
